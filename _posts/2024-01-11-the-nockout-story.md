As the co-founders of [**Nockout**](https://nockout.co), Yash and I, Subramanya, have been on a quest to solve a problem that plagues every sports enthusiast: finding the right place and the right people for playing sports. Our personal struggles with organizing sports activities have led us to create a platform that not only eases these challenges but also promotes a sense of community among sports lovers.

### The Problem: A Universal Challenge
Our frustrations weren't unique. Across the globe, from tennis courts to basketball hoops, sports enthusiasts were grappling with the same issues: finding the right venue and the right people to play with. This global dilemma was evident in the shared experiences voiced through numerous tweets and conversations among the community.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bay Club is pretty good. But also trying to find a reliable way to find players is hard (even using PyC).</p>&mdash; Gautam (@gautamtata) <a href="https://twitter.com/gautamtata/status/1741899381442572543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">someone create an app that shows all public basketball courts and whether or not people are at them or not. this would save a lot of time for me lol.</p>&mdash; thao üçâ (@holycowitsthao) <a href="https://twitter.com/holycowitsthao/status/1372340571470233603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2021</a></blockquote>
